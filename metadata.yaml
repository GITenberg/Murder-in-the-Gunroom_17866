description: It was hard to judge Jeff Rand's age from his appearance; he was certainly
  over thirty and considerably under fifty. He looked hard and fit like a man who
  could be a serviceable friend or a particularly unpleasant enemy. Women instinctively
  suspected that he would make a most satisfying lover.' (Excerpt)
